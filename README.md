In this Project: Understanding Abstract Classes, Methods, and Interfaces in Python
Overview
In this project, I cleared the concepts of abstract classes, abstract methods, concrete methods, and interfaces in Python. These concepts are crucial for designing robust and flexible object-oriented programs.
Topics Covered
Abstract Class
An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed. It serves as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes allow you to define methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. They are defined using the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module.
Abstract Method
An abstract method is a method declared in an abstract class that does not contain implementation. Subclasses of the abstract class are required to implement these methods. Abstract methods are defined using the @abstractmethod decorator. This ensures that the derived classes provide specific implementations for the abstract methods.
Concrete Method
A concrete method is a regular method defined in an abstract class. It has an implementation and can be inherited by subclasses. Concrete methods provide common functionality that can be used directly by subclasses or overridden as needed.
Interface
An interface in Python is a collection of abstract methods. A class that implements an interface must provide implementations for all of its methods. Python does not have a built-in interface keyword, but interfaces can be created using abstract base classes. Interfaces define a contract for what methods a class should implement, promoting consistency and ensuring that different classes adhere to the same method signatures.
